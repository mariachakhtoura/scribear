# SCRIBEAR

SCRIBEAR is a free web app that makes the process of transcribing recordings in Arabic smoother and faster. Through its shortcuts, SCRIBEAR eliminates the need to switch back and forth between your media player and your Word document to pause, rewind and fast-forward. It also allows you to type with more ease and without the need for an Arabic Keyboard by using a transliteration engine, powered by Yamli, that converts words typed in Latin letters to their closest Arabic equivalent.
